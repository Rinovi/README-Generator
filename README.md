# README.md Generator

## Description

The following is a project that allows a user to quickly and dynamically generate a README.md file that is both professional and organized. In fact, most of this README was generated by using the project itself. 
This project employs the use of inquirer, and only asks that the user uses the command line to 'npm install' the dependencies for "Inquirer V.8.2.4", run node index.js, and then follow the prompts to create one's own professional README file.
The following is an image of what one may see while following the prompts to generate a README file:
